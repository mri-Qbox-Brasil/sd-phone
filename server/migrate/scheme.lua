---@type table Import identity scheme (server.migrate.scheme). Decides whether an import keys its
---rows on the CHARACTER (stock sd-phone) or on each PHONE (unique phones), and pins that choice
---for the life of the database so a later config change can never re-key rows already in place.
---
---lb-phone partitions its data by phone number - every table carries `phone_number` with a foreign
---key onto phone_phones - so a character holding two phones has two genuinely separate sets of
---contacts, photos and app accounts. sd-phone partitions by identity string. Keying one identity
---per number is what preserves that; keying one per character merges them and throws the second
---number away.
---
---A database already imported per character is not refused. Each phone keys on whichever identity
---already holds its number, falling back to `sim:<number>` when nothing does, so a later run tops
---up only the phones the first one left behind and rewrites none of its rows. That is the same
---precedence server/sim/store.lua resolves a number by at runtime, so the import and the phone
---agree by construction.
